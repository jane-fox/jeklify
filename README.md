## How to do the thing

1. Make a list of every page on a website (eg with screaming frog), seperated by new lines.

	- List must be only to the pages, no assets or external links
	- Avoid having duplicates, either by different protocol or with/without trailing slash
	
2. Edit script's init to your list, and give it the base url of your site



3. `node convert.js` will start it running, default output is to /websites/
